  description:
    "A message from Mr. Dhammika Hewawasam, Principal of St. Thomas' College, Matale since 2020.",

const paragraphs = [
  "When I first walked through these gates as Principal in 2020, a Grade 8 boy held the door for me, then apologised — not for nearly missing the gesture, but for being three seconds late to his class. In that small exchange I understood exactly what this college is: a place where standards are not enforced, but inherited.",
  "For over 150 years, St. Thomas' College has believed that true education is measured not only in grades, but in grace — the quiet confidence of a boy who knows who he is. Grades open doors; character decides what you do in the room. We are determined that our students are fluent in both.",
  "Our promise to every family is simple and severe: we will know your son. We will know his name, his temperament, the subject that frightens him and the one that makes him lose track of time. In an era of mass education, we remain deliberately, defiantly personal. Classes are small, counsellors are present, and no boy here is ever merely a registration number.",
  "We pair that intimacy with genuine rigour. Our laboratories hum after hours, Robinson Memorial Hall opens before dawn, and our teachers — many of whom gave up their Saturdays for years — hold our students to standards that have produced island-first results across four Advanced Level streams. Excellence here is not an accident; it is a habit, rehearsed daily.",
  "But a school that only teaches is a factory with a crest. Between the finish at the hundred-metre line and the final drum of Thomian Nite, our boys learn to lead a team, to lose with dignity, to argue a case they did not choose, and to serve a community that will never know their name. These are not extras. At St. Thomas', they are the curriculum.",
  "To our Old Thomians: you remain our proudest export. Wherever you stand today — a parade ground, a lecture hall, a hospital theatre, a start-up — know that you carry Matale with you, and that these gates are always open to you.",
  "And to every parent considering this college for their son: I do not ask you to take my word. Come and see. Hear the choir drift from Robinson Memorial Hall. Watch a junior debugger celebrate his first working circuit. Stand at the boundary edge on a Battle of the Golds morning and feel what a century and a half of brotherhood sounds like. Then decide. I am confident what you will decide.",
